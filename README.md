## **Installation & Setup**

### **1. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Logging in to Instagram**

- If a login session exists (stored via cookies), WebWeave will automatically authenticate.
- If no session is found, you will be prompted to enter your **username and password**.
- Once logged in, WebWeave saves the session, so you wonâ€™t need to log in again unless the session expires.

### **3. Scraping a Targetâ€™s Network**

To analyze a user's network:

1. Enter the **Instagram username** (must be accurate).
2. Provide the **personâ€™s actual name** (for reference purposes).
3. WebWeave will scrape the user's **followers and followings**, storing them in a PostgreSQL database.

You can scrape as many users as needed to expand your network visualization.

### **4. Visualizing the Network**

Once data is collected, generate the social graph with:

```bash
python visualize.py
```

This will open an interactive visualization of the network, showing connections between users.
